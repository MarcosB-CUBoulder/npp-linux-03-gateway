# Introduction

This set of demos and lab goes along with the coursera course: `Network Principles in Practice: Linux Networking`.  You are welcome to run this code and I try to make it as self explanatory as possible, but some of the explanation will be in the videos for the course.

NOTE: Mac M1/M2 users should refer to the guidance [here](https://github.com/eric-keller/npp-linux-01-intro/blob/main/mac-arm/README.md)

# Vagrantfile

A Vagrantfile is provided that will create a Ubuntu 22.04 VM, and install the needed software on the VM.

This was tested using vagrant VirtualBox running on Windows 11.

```
vagrant up
```


Configure your ssh client with the following.  I use [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).
Hostname/IP address: 127.0.0.1
Port number: 2222
Username: vagrant
Private Key: <path/to/private_key>
Note: youâ€™ll want x11 forwarding on

To get the location of the private key:

```
vagrant ssh-config
```


When you want to stop the VM, you can either run `vagrant suspend` to save the state so you can resume it later with `vagrant up`, or `vagrant halt` to shut the VM down.
